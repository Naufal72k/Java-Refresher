# Java-Refresher
This repository is my personal bootcamp to get back into Java. After some time away, I'm using this space to review fundamental concepts, practice with new features from recent Java versions, and tackle small-to-medium-sized projects to solidify my knowledge. Think of it as a journal of my journey to master Java once again.
